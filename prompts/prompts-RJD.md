# 1 - Copilot 4o

can you talk to me about this project. Do not repeat all the info in the #file:README.md try to provide a summary of what it does. 
Keep a perspective of a devsecops as our job is to deploy this project using terraform

# 2

@workspace what services, credentials and accounts do we need to deploy this on aws using terraform, from a github action deployment file

# 3

@workspace i dont have an s3 butcket created, do i create one or will terraform do that?

# 4

sounds good. Lets start with our first task first. Creating a github action to perform all the tasks needed. Lets modularize it and go step by step. 

For our first step we will create the base structure of our github action yml.

We will code it into #file:ci.yml 

# 5

@workspace our first job will be to build. our second job will be to run the tests, which i believe is an npm test on the backend and a cypress test on the frontend.
We will also run this job whenever a pull request is created to main branch

# 6

building backend failed. Full stacktrace is:

```
full stacktrace copied here
```

# 7

now our frontend build failed. The log is:

```
full stacktrace copied here
```

# 8

@workspace lets try to run our frontend tests locally. Guide me through it

# 9

i dont see any frontend tests, lets remove it from the test job

# 10

@workspace both jobs were executed successfully. I suppose our next step is creating the job to execute our terraform script. if this is correct, lets start by reviewing our terraform scripts, getting all our environmental variables needed and configuring the new job. 
For the AWS steps provide detailed description on what i should do

# 11

@workspace guide me on getting the info requested on these variables

Step 2: Identify Environment Variables
From the provided context, the following environment variables are commonly used in Terraform configurations for AWS:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS access key ID.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS secret access key.
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: The AWS region to deploy resources (e.g., us-east-1).
S3_BUCKET: The S3 bucket to store code.
PROJECT_NAME: The name of the project.

# 12 - ChatGPT 4o

I need help setting up a github action deployment into an AWS using terraform. I have no knowledge on AWS but i know terraform can create the users, group, roles, the s3 bucket and everything. My AWS account has a root user with MFA and no active access keys and nothing else. Act as an expert devops with aws knowledge and guide me into setting up my aws account to allow my repository to do a deployment using terraform and github actions.

# 13

in this point 

1.2 Create an IAM User:
	•	Go to Users → Add Users
	•	Name: terraform-github-actions
	•	Access Type: Select Programmatic access (Needed for GitHub Actions)
	•	Click Next: Permissions

I dont see a check for programmatic access. did this change? 

# 14

I will go with access key for this test. I also need to create a free trial account on datadog and set it up on my terraform. Can you walkthrough me with this setup? Im on macos 

# 15 - Copilot 4o

our first goal should be to setup the AWS s3 bucket, iam user, iam role, iam group, ec2 instance. the minimum needed to start a deployment. I need your help achieving this.

# 16

@workspace how does our terraform scripts work in this case? what will be the steps it will take

# 17

@workspace our deploy is working with terraform, can we make make a step to test our environment variables? the ones needed to be set in our project

# 18

@workspace we also need to test our datadog variables

# 19

what variables do we have and where do they need to be set?

# 20

@workspace isnt our terraform IaC supposed to deal with s3 bucket? also what is our project name referring to?

# 21

so even though terraform is dealing with the s3 bucket, we need to set the secret on github?

# 22

@workspace provide help with this point

```
	3.	AWS S3 Bucket Warnings
	•	Warnings indicate deprecated attributes in your Terraform S3 configuration:
	•	acl = "private" should be replaced with aws_s3_bucket_acl.
	•	aws_s3_bucket_object is deprecated in favor of aws_s3_object.
```

either on #file:main.tf or #file:s3.tf or any other file required to be updated

# 30

@workspace now provide a fix for this warning:
```
2.	Null Resource (null_resource.generate_zip)
	•	This is a Terraform resource that executes a local action (e.g., running a script to generate a ZIP file).
	•	The triggers block is changing, which forces a replacement of this resource.
```

# 31

@workspace now we need to fix this error:

```
	4.	Critical Error: AWS Provider Authentication Failure
	•	Terraform cannot authenticate to AWS because no valid credentials are found.
	•	The error suggests Terraform is attempting to use EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS), which only works on an AWS EC2 instance.
	•	The error failed to refresh cached credentials confirms Terraform is failing to find credentials locally.

lets try changing the butcket name to `lti-project-code-bucket-rjd` what are my next steps to debug? my `terraform apply` still failing and i cannot find my bucket when listing with `aws s3 ls | grep lti-project-code-bucket`

# 48

terraform statis list grep bucket is showing this result:

```
terraform state list | grep aws_s3_bucket
aws_s3_bucket_object.backend_zip
aws_s3_bucket_object.frontend_zip
```

I dont see the bucket anymore even after running terraform apply, is this ok?

# 49

lets validate the entire output for my terraform plan:


```
copied full output terraform plan
```

# 50

I suppose the bucket will be recreated each time the terraform is applied but the execution of `aws s3 ls | grep lti-project-code-bucket-rjd` results in a bucket with timestamp of several minutes ago

# 51

lets check files one by one. First review my main.tf 

# 52

now validate my s3.tf

where is this command executed? in my aws? currently my terraform scripts are inside a `tf` folder in my project root. And the `generar-zip.sh` script is in the root folder with the zip files


# 56 - Copilot 4o

if i try to run this script locally from my tf folder using `sh ../generar-zip.sh` the zip files are not generated and I get the response output:

# 61 - ChatGPT 4o

can i delete selected resources to try and validate if the issue comes from the zip generation and transfer?

# 62

i created the policy DatadogPolicy manually, how do i delete it?

# 63

terraform executed, how do i validate if the bucket was created correctly

# 64

my bucket was created and terraform script ran correctly, which means the issue is with my zip generation and subsequent upload to the bucket.

Lets try to fix this step by step.

1. my terraform is located in my root/tf folder
2. my generar-zip.sh script is located in my root folder

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Definir las rutas de los archivos zip
BACKEND_ZIP="../backend.zip"
FRONTEND_ZIP="../frontend.zip"

# Función para eliminar un archivo si existe
remove_zip_if_exists() {
    local zip_file="$1"
    if [ -f "$zip_file" ]; then
        rm "$zip_file"
        echo "Eliminado $zip_file"
    fi
}

# Función para crear un archivo zip si el directorio existe
create_zip_if_dir_exists() {
    local dir="$1"
    local zip_file="$2"
    if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
        zip -r "$zip_file" "$dir/"
        echo "Creado $zip_file"
    else
        echo "Directorio $dir no encontrado, no se creó $zip_file"
    fi
}

# Remover los antiguos archivos zip
remove_zip_if_exists "$BACKEND_ZIP"
remove_zip_if_exists "$FRONTEND_ZIP"

# Crear nuevos archivos zip para backend y frontend
create_zip_if_dir_exists "../backend" "$BACKEND_ZIP"
create_zip_if_dir_exists "../frontend" "$FRONTEND_ZIP"
```

3. my zip files are generated in my root folder
4. my s3.tf file is currently only generating the bucket

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "code_bucket" {
  bucket        = "lti-project-code-bucket-rjd"
  force_destroy = true
}
```

we need to generate the zip files and upload them into s3 bucket after

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform planned the following actions, but then encountered a problem:
